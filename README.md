# Healthcare--Data---Analysis---Powerbi
Analysing the healthcare data of patients using SQL , Python and Power Bi Dashboards
Healthcare Dataset Analysis and Dashboard Reporting Project
This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of healthcare data using Power BI. It focuses on understanding patient distribution, billing trends, and hospital performance through a clean and interactive dashboard.

## Project Overview
The Healthcare Data Dashboard project is a personal data visualization initiative aimed at exploring key insights from a large-scale healthcare dataset containing over 55,000 patient records. The dataset includes demographic details, admission types, billing amounts, medical conditions, and hospital metadata. The primary focus of this project is to apply data cleaning, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and design an interactive Power BI dashboard to reveal trends and patterns that are critical in healthcare operations. With tools like Excel for preprocessing and Power BI for reporting, this project showcases how raw data can be transformed into meaningful visual insights that support better decision-making in the healthcare sector.

## Project Goals
Perform data cleaning and preparation of raw healthcare data
Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and distributions
Build an interactive dashboard in Power BI to display key insights
Present insights to support decision-making in healthcare management
